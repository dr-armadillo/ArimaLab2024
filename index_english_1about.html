    <h2>Mission Statement<br><br>Recommendations for Small Failures<br>Making Skills into Strengths / Have a mindset of self-investment<br>Growing Strengths</h2>
    <img class="separator" src="img/dot1.png" width="67" height="72">
    <p><b>Recommendations for Small Failures</b><br>
      　The Arima Laboratory conducts a wide range of research linking microorganisms, enzymes, and substances, while also focusing on the development of human resources to run the laboratory.<br>
      　Research is filled with many small failures.　Those who have succeeded in research have reached success by using their many failures as tools and experiences.　The same can be said for successful people outside of research.　But too big a failure can make life untenable.　Even in the research field, a major failure can waste years of time and money.　On the other hand, people grow by making small mistakes and taking positive actions of "reflection and improvement," and many opportunities for growth are packed into small failures.　I have had many failures, and I have my current project on the back of them.　I have not yet succeeded, but I am confident that I have made more failures than any other researcher.　Still, I have not had any major failures, which has led me to where I am today.　Therefore, I am working on various initiatives on the topics of how to avoid big failures, how to grow through small failures, and basic ideas.</p>
      <img class="separator" src="img/dot1.png" width="67" height="72">
    <p><b>Making Skills into Strengths!　Have a mindset of self-investment!</b><br>
      　What you can learn from research is not only specialized knowledge, but also a wide range of other things, such as how to proceed with a project, how to think for a project, how to obtain information to a project, etc. To master these things, you will need to use your "time" as a precious resource.　In order to acquire such knowledge, you will need to use the precious resource of "time".<br>
      　We feel that it is also necessary to spend time thinking about what techniques (qualifications, education, skills, and mindset) will be necessary in the future.　The development of students' skills and mindset by investing time is directly related to your growth and the value the students will create in the future.　In our lab, we also make an effort to improve the skills of students while exposing them to the values of various people during that precious time.　I share the opportunity to share our strengths and choices with all people through various opportunities such as drinking, roundtable discussions, meetings, etc.</p>
      <img class="separator" src="img/dot1.png" width="67" height="72">
    <p><b>Growing Strengths</b><br>
      　What is a person's strength?　According to someone I respect, a "strength" is what a person has that makes him or her overwhelmingly different from others.　And most importantly, that difference creates value.　I think so, too.　For example, have you ever been praised or appreciated by others even though you think you are doing something very simple?　That simple thing is a great thing from the other person's point of view, and having such an ability is a strength for that person.<br>
      　Through the activities and connections of research, our laboratory seeks ways to utilize and complement each other's strengths and to develop our strengths.　The student-professor relationship is one of the relationship between people.　It takes time to build a relationship that fosters mutual strengths.　Our lab is strongly interested in assigning a student who will be entering a graduate student affiliated with Tottori University / our lab.</p>
