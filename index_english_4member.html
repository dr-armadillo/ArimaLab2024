    <h2>Policies in Student Teaching</h2>
    <h2>The "great power" of mind and behavior that is not apparent</h2>
    <img class="separator" src="img/dot1.png" width="67" height="72">
    <p><b>View one's advantages and disadvantages as "Individuality"!   Generate ideas from chit-chat!   Let's develop strengths instead of overcoming weak points!:<br>
    In our Mission Statement, there are the following statements: "Let's recognize each other's Individuality" "Let's cultivate ideas through frequent chit-chat" and "Let's separate 'weak points' from 'things we don't understand or can't do.</b><br><br>
    <b>Individuality:　</b>We all have the option of individuality apart from ability.　Individuality can be an advantages or a disadvantages depending on the person you are dealing with, but individuality is an individual characteristic.　We tend to separate advantages and disadvantages in our feelings toward each individual and the other person, but it is important to view them together as "individuality" and how we deal with ourselves and the other person.　The ideal is to know each other, to know what each other is doing, to know what each other is thinking, and to build a cooperative relationship.<br>
    <b>Chit-chat: 　</b>Chatting is often seen as a meaningless activity, but it is actually a time to share each other's values, and many ideas, etc., arise from chatting.　On the other hand, there are no good ideas that come from thinking about generating ideas.　After all, the brain is reset in an opportunity like a chat, and the ideas that come out of a fresh brain network are distinctly different from the ideas that come out of being trapped in biases and ties.　Chit-chat has the power to solve a variety of problems.　We hope to use this as a driving force for the creation of ideas at the Arima lab., which are not always visible to the naked eye.<br>
    <b>Develop your strengths:　</b>The majority of " weak points" are those that have been experienced many times before and have accumulated to the point where one's quality is inferior to that of others.　We do not call something " weak point" if you have never done it before or do not understand it, or if you have tried it a few times and it did not work out.　There is no way to qualify " weak points" except by experiencing it and evaluating it for yourself.　On the other hand, a true weak point will cause pain.　Therefore, it is better to give up on overcoming your weak points and develop your strong points.　This reduces the extent to which "difficulties" occupy time in your life and expands the amount of time (fulfilling time) that you are "good" at.　Also, sometimes your weak point may be someone else's strong point.　If you can find this out, you may be able to build a win-win relationship.<br>
